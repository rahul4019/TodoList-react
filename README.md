# Todo List

This Todo list is built using ReactJs and it is using [Jsonplacehoder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) API to fetch todos, add new todo, delete a todo and update a todo. However, except for fetching the todos, the other three requests are dummy requests (not changing data on the server).
